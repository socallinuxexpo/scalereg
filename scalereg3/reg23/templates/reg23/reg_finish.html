    <table>

    <td>Name:</td>
    <td>{{ attendee.first_name }} {{ attendee.last_name }}</td>

    <td>{{ attendee.email }}</td>
    </tr>

    <td>Registration Number:</td>
    <td>{{ attendee.id }}</td>

    <tr>
    <td>Ticket Type:</td>
    <td>{{ attendee.badge_type.description }}</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td>Registration Status:</td>
    <td><b>Unpaid</b></td>
    </tr>
    </table>
    </p>

    <p>
    To pay for your registration, click "Pay For Registration" below. You can then pay via credit card, or redeem a coupon if you have one.
    </p>

    <p>
    If you would like someone else to pay for your ticket, give them your
    email address and registration number. For instance, three coworkers can
    all register themselves separately, give their registration numbers to
    their manager, and have their manager pay for all the tickets at once.
