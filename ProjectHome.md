This is the registration system used by SCALE, the Southern California Linux Expo. This registration software helped us run a smooth show for over 1000 attendees during SCALE 6X. We are releasing this code so other Open Source conferences can benefit from it as well.

The SCALE Registration System (scalereg) is written in Python and uses [the Django framework](http://www.djangoproject.com/).
